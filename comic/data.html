<!--The data.html page displays all the data that we have collected for this project. I have tried my best to display data relating sales, 
trends, genres of indie comics vs mainstream comics and how the data supports the steady rise of indie comics. Lack of experience with coding,
especially with chart.js and Highcharts proved to be challenging, as can be seen in this page how I am not able to program the Highcharts map 
to load. Another challenge was the presentation of data itself - I have managed to keep it simple as I was not able to customise the looks of it
as much, just sticking to the basic customisation CSS provides. (Editor Note - Ishmaam) -->
