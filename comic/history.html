      <h2>The Origins</h2>
      <p>Indie comics trace their roots back to the underground comix movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Artists like Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, and Harvey Pekar created work outside the mainstream comic industry, tackling subjects that were too controversial or niche for traditional publishers.</p>
      <p>These early pioneers self-published or worked with small independent publishers, establishing the DIY ethos that would define indie comics for decades to come. The raw, unfiltered artistic expression found in these comics challenged the Comics Code Authority and expanded what comics could be.</p>

      <h2>The Alternative Comics Era</h2>
      <p>In the 1980s and early 1990s, the indie comics scene evolved into what became known as "alternative comics." This period saw the rise of influential publishers like Fantagraphics Books and Drawn & Quarterly, who provided platforms for independent creators to reach wider audiences.</p>
      <p>Works like "Love and Rockets" by the Hernandez brothers, "Eightball" by Daniel Clowes, and "Optic Nerve" by Adrian Tomine showcased the artistic diversity and narrative complexity that indie comics could achieve. These comics often featured deeply personal stories and experimental styles rarely seen in mainstream publications.</p>
